# Punting Club

This project was started in week 4 of the EDA Bootcamp. This was a personal project which we had to present in week 6. 

I was managing a spreadsheet for a social club I have with some friends. The idea of the club was to take it in turns to spend $30 per couple at the TAB. The money stayed in the account (including all losses and wins). After one year, we take whatever money we have (or don't have) and use it to go on holiday. 

Each week I was calculating how much each couple had bet and how much they had won to work out which couple was winning. The winner at the end of each year has the honour to book the holiday for everyone. 

This project is a way for me to transfer my excel spreadsheet skills (from my prior background in accounting) and translate them onto a working web application. 

I am using Node and Express on the back end and React and Redux on the front end.
